# Enhanced Risk Management & Dynamic Intervention System

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Original Issue**: The current 5 fixed intervention scenarios (Task Reassignment, Overtime Authorization, Additional Resource, Deadline Extension, Scope Reduction) cannot address the diverse range of risks that can emerge in real projects.

**Root Cause**: Project risks are far more varied than just resource allocation issues. Real projects face technical, external, team, business, operational, financial, timeline, scope, and quality risks that require different intervention strategies.

## 🚀 Solution: Dynamic AI-Driven Risk & Intervention Framework

### **Enhanced Architecture**

#### **1. Comprehensive Risk Categories (10 Types)**
```
1. Resource & Allocation - Team capacity, skills, utilization
2. Technical & Quality - Technical debt, integration issues
3. External Dependencies - Vendor delays, API issues
4. Team Dynamics - Communication, conflicts, knowledge silos
5. Business & Strategic - Changing requirements, market shifts
6. Operational - Infrastructure, tools, processes
7. Financial & Budget - Cost overruns, budget constraints
8. Timeline & Schedule - Deadline pressure, sequencing
9. Scope & Requirements - Scope creep, unclear requirements
10. Quality & Standards - Quality issues, compliance gaps
```

#### **2. Dynamic Intervention Types (13+ Options)**
```
ORIGINAL (5):
✅ Task Reassignment
