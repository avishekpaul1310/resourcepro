## üéØ Use Cases

### 1. Distributed Team Management
Perfect for teams spread across multiple timezones:
- See who's available right now
- Plan meetings during overlapping hours
- Understand team member locations and contexts

### 2. Client Project Staffing

- Match resources in compatible timezones
- Ensure coverage during client business hours
- Plan handoffs between time zones

### 3. Remote Work Planning
For hybrid and remote teams:
- Track team member locations
- Optimize collaboration windows
- Plan asynchronous vs. synchronous work

## üìä Visual Indicators

### Business Hours Status
- **üü¢ Green Time**: Currently in business hours (9 AM - 5 PM local time, weekdays)
- **üî¥ Red Time**: Outside business hours (evenings, nights, weekends)

### Timezone Overlap
- **Green Highlighted Hours**: Times when all team members are in business hours
- **Gray Hours**: Times when some/all team members are outside business hours
- **Overlap Badge**: Shows total number of overlapping hours

## üîß Technical Details

### Timezone Support
- Uses IANA timezone database via Python's `pytz` library
- All timestamps are timezone-aware
- Automatic daylight saving time handling
- Fallback to UTC for invalid timezones

### Database Fields
```python
# Added to Resource model
timezone = models.CharField(max_length=100, default='UTC')
location = models.CharField(max_length=200, blank=True, null=True)
```

### Template Tags
Custom template tags for timezone functionality:
- `format_local_time`: Display resource's local time
- `is_business_hours`: Check business hours status
- `show_timezone_overlap`: Display team overlap widget
- `format_utc_hour_for_resource`: Convert UTC to local time

## üìù Best Practices

### 1. Timezone Selection
- Use specific timezones (e.g., `US/Eastern`) rather than abbreviations (EST)
- Consider daylight saving time changes
- Update timezones when team members relocate

### 2. Team Planning
- Schedule regular meetings during overlap hours
- Use asynchronous communication when no overlap exists
- Document timezone considerations in project plans

### 3. Client Communication
- Always specify timezone in meeting invitations
- Use team overlap visualization for client demonstrations
- Consider client timezone when staffing projects

## üöÄ Advanced Features

### Overlap Calculation
The system calculates overlapping business hours by:
1. Converting each resource's business hours (9 AM - 5 PM) to UTC
2. Finding intersections across all team members
3. Accounting for weekends and holidays
4. Displaying results in both UTC and local times

### Integration Points
The timezone features integrate with:
- **Resource Management**: Core resource data and forms
- **Allocation Board**: Team planning and assignment
- **Calendar System**: Event scheduling and availability
- **Reporting**: Utilization and analytics (timezone-aware)

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
- Custom business hours per resource
- Holiday calendars by country/region
- Notification scheduling based on recipient timezone
- Project-level timezone preferences
- Time tracking across timezones
- Advanced overlap analysis and reporting

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Timezone Not Recognized**:
   - Ensure you're using valid IANA timezone names
   - Check spelling and case sensitivity
   - Use the dropdown for common timezones

2. **Times Not Updating**:
   - Refresh the page to see current times
   - Check that the resource has a valid timezone set
   - Verify system time is correct

3. **No Overlap Showing**:
   - Ensure all team members have timezones set
   - Check that team has at least 2 members
   - Verify business hours (9 AM - 5 PM weekdays)

### Getting Help
- Check the Django logs for timezone-related errors
- Verify `pytz` is installed: `pip install pytz`
- Test timezone methods in Django shell
