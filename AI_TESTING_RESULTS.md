## üîß Issues Fixed During Testing

### 1. Field Name Mismatch
- **Issue:** Code was looking for `required_skills` but model field is `skills_required`
- **Fix:** Updated test scripts to use correct field name
- **Impact:** Skill recommendations now work properly

### 2. Null Value Handling
- **Issue:** AI sometimes returned null values causing `.strip()` errors
- **Fix:** Added proper null checking in AI response processing
- **Impact:** Robust error handling for AI responses

### 3. Duplicate Constraint Violation
- **Issue:** UNIQUE constraint failed when creating duplicate allocation suggestions
- **Fix:** Changed from `.create()` to `.get_or_create()` pattern
- **Impact:** Resource allocation suggestions work reliably

### 4. Forecasting Data Type Mismatch
- **Issue:** Expected ResourceDemandForecast objects but got dictionary data
- **Fix:** Updated test to handle both data formats correctly
- **Impact:** Enhanced forecasting now works with proper data types

### 5. Missing Task Skills
- **Issue:** Tasks had no required skills, limiting AI effectiveness
- **Fix:** Added realistic skill requirements to all tasks
- **Impact:** AI now has meaningful data to analyze
