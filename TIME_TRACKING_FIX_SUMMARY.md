## ✅ Time Tracking Issue - RESOLVED

### **Problem Summary**
The Time Tracking page filters were not working properly, and the summary statistics (Total Hours, Billable Hours, etc.) were showing empty values.

### **Root Causes Identified**
1. **Missing filtering logic** - The `time_entry_list` view was only handling basic resource and date filtering
2. **Missing context data** - The view wasn't providing the necessary context variables for the template
3. **Missing project filtering** - No support for filtering by project
4. **Missing billable filtering** - The `TimeEntry` model lacked a billable field
5. **Missing summary calculations** - No logic to calculate total hours, billable hours, estimated value, etc.
6. **Template relationship issue** - Template was trying to access `entry.project.name` but should be `entry.task.project.name`

### **Solutions Implemented**

#### 1. **Enhanced TimeEntry Model**
- ✅ Added `is_billable` field to track billable vs non-billable time
- ✅ Created and applied database migration
- ✅ Updated admin interface to include billable field
- ✅ Updated TimeEntry form to include billable checkbox

#### 2. **Improved time_entry_list View** 
- ✅ Added comprehensive filtering for:
  - Resource filtering
  - Project filtering (through task relationship)
  - Date range filtering (start_date, end_date)
  - Billable status filtering
- ✅ Added summary statistics calculations:
  - Total entries count
  - Total hours sum
  - Billable hours sum
  - Billable percentage calculation
  - Estimated value calculation based on resource hourly rates
- ✅ Proper context data for dropdown filters

#### 3. **Fixed Template Issues**
- ✅ Corrected project access from `entry.project.name` to `entry.task.project.name`
- ✅ All template variables now have proper context data

#### 4. **Added Test Data**
- ✅ Created both billable and non-billable entries for testing
- ✅ Verified filtering works with mixed data
