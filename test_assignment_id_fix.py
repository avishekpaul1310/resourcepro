    print("❌ Clicking the delete icon was targeting the <i> element instead of the <button>")
    print("❌ The <i> element doesn't have data-assignment-id attribute")
    print("❌ This caused assignment_id to be undefined, triggering 'Assignment ID required' error")
    print("❌ Multiple clicks sometimes worked because they eventually hit the button element")
