# Jira Integration Cleanup Summary

## Files Removed

The following actual Jira integration implementation files have been removed from the project:

### ✅ Deleted Files:
1. **`integrations/jira_integration.py`** - Complete Jira integration implementation class
2. **`.env`** - Removed `JIRA_API_TOKEN` configuration line

### ✅ What Remains (Documentation Only):
1. **`EXTERNAL_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`** - Contains Jira as example implementation (kept as reference)
2. **`API_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`** - Technical integration documentation
3. **`api_integration_examples.py`** - Code templates and examples

## Summary

- **Removed**: All actual implementation files for Jira integration
- **Kept**: Documentation and examples showing how integration would work
- **Result**: Project contains comprehensive integration examples without forcing Jira dependency

The documentation still provides:
- Complete Jira integration example code
- Patterns that can be adapted for any PM tool (Asana, Monday.com, etc.)
- Authentication, sync, and error handling patterns
- Real-world implementation guidance

Users can now reference the examples to understand integration concepts and build their own integrations with their preferred tools, without any actual Jira dependencies in the codebase.

## Current State

✅ **Clean codebase** - No implementation dependencies  
✅ **Comprehensive examples** - Full integration patterns documented  
✅ **Flexible approach** - Examples can be adapted for any tool  
✅ **Educational value** - Clear understanding of integration concepts  

The project now serves as a perfect blueprint for API integration without being tied to any specific external tool.
