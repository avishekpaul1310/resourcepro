   ```
   Success Probability: 80-90%
   Cost Impact: $500-1000
   Timeline: Meet deadline
   Risks: Burnout, sustainability
   ```

### Phase 4: Test Additional Resource (Skill Gap)

**Target Risk**: "API Integration Skill Gap"

1. **Select Scenario**: "Additional Resource"

2. **Configure New Resource**
   ```
   Required Role: Senior API Developer
