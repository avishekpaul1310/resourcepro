# AI Search Global Availability Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## 🎯 Issue Identified

The intelligent AI search with voice and text functionality was only working on the **Dashboard** page, despite the search interface being visible on all pages (Projects, Resources, Allocation, Analytics).

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### What Was Working:
- ✅ **Search Interface**: The AI search bar with microphone icon was globally available via `templates/includes/header.html`
- ✅ **Backend API**: The `/dashboard/api/nli-query/` endpoint was functional
- ✅ **AI Processing**: The `NaturalLanguageInterfaceService` was working correctly

### What Was Broken:
- ❌ **JavaScript Loading**: The `ai_dashboard.js` file was only loaded on the dashboard page
- ❌ **Function Initialization**: Search functions like `initializeNLISearch()`, `toggleVoiceSearch()`, etc. were not available on other pages
- ❌ **Event Listeners**: Click handlers for voice button and input field were not attached on non-dashboard pages

## 🔧 Technical Fix Applied

### 1. **Global JavaScript Loading**
**File Modified**: `templates/base.html`
```html
<!-- Before -->
<script src="{% static 'js/main.js' %}"></script>
{% block extra_js %}{% endblock %}

<!-- After -->
<script src="{% static 'js/main.js' %}"></script>
<script src="{% static 'js/ai_dashboard.js' %}"></script>  <!-- Added -->
{% block extra_js %}{% endblock %}
```

### 2. **Removed Duplicate Loading**
**File Modified**: `dashboard/templates/dashboard/dashboard.html`
```html
<!-- Removed this section -->
<!-- AI Features Scripts -->
<script src="{% static 'js/ai_dashboard.js' %}"></script>
```

### 3. **Static Files Collection**
- Ran `python manage.py collectstatic --noinput` to ensure updated files are served

## ✅ What's Now Working

### Global Availability:
- 🎤 **Voice Search**: Works on Dashboard, Projects, Resources, Allocation, Analytics
